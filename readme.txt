Automate the process of taking website screenshots.

== Description ==

Use the `[browser-shot]` shortcode to automate the process of taking website screenshots. An icon is also added to the TinyMCE editor to make the shortcode creation process easy.

= Shortcode Preview =

`[browser-shot url="http://link-to-website" width="600"]`

= Multisite Compatibility =

The *Browser Shots* plugin is compatibly with WordPress Multisite, just use the [Network Activate](http://codex.wordpress.org/Create_A_Network#WordPress_Plugins) feature to enable the shortcode on every site. If you only want to enable the shortcode for a specific site, activate the plugin for that site only.

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

2. The formatted front-end view of generated screenshots. [See a live example](http://www.kevinleary.net/great-examples-software-web-design/)
